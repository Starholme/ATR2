TODO:

	For now:
		Keep as mod
		Expand scenario to add extra features, like world eater

	Next steps:
		Add intro GUI from OARC
		Get TLS working for prod cluster, documented

	Setup backups for cluster root/database folder
	Document setting ports for each instance factorio.game_port: https://github.com/clusterio/factorioClusterio/blob/master/docs/configuration.md


What is MVP?
	Running cluster on box - DONE
	TLS setup - DONE
	Connectable instance

TODO:

	For now:
		Keep as mod
		Expand scenario to add extra features, like world eater

	Next steps:
		Fix GUI text not updating
		Get two instances running
			One a ribbon?
			One a resource rich?
		Add and test out the stats export plugin: https://github.com/clusterio/factorioClusterio/blob/master/plugins/statistics_exporter/README.md
		Should show up at https://alltherockets.duckdns.org/clusterio/metrics



	Setup backups for cluster root/database folder
	Document setting ports for each instance factorio.game_port: https://github.com/clusterio/factorioClusterio/blob/master/docs/configuration.md


What is MVP?
